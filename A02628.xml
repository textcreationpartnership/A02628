            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By which and other like places, I was moued to examine my <hi>profe≈øsion</hi> whether it were of Gods in≈øtitution, and e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall command ≈øpecified to vs, or whether <hi>God</hi> were the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of tho≈øe <hi>Seruices</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which now beate great ≈øway in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and after due examination I found out for certaine that many points of the <hi>Religion,</hi> now embraced by the <hi>Romani≈øts</hi> are not to be found within the volume of Gods Word.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15581:5"/>are the≈øe <hi>Statutes?</hi> they are the Word of God, contayned in the Law and the Prophets: which are the rule of our Life, and the ≈øquare of our Faith, and the very Oracle of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, from Heauen to reueale his <hi>will</hi> vnto vs, for certaine it is that Chri≈øt came not to de≈øtroy the <hi>Law,</hi> but to fulfill it: hee ≈øwarued not from the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, neither did the <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> teach any thing vpon their owne will and di≈øcretion, but the Doctrine which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of Chri≈øt, they faithfully deliuered it vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Nations.</p>
            <p>And this they preached at the fir≈øt in <hi>viua voce:,</hi> that is, in a liuely Voyce, and afterward deliuered it vnto vs in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to be the foundation and Pillar of our Faith, <hi>Qui hoc credit</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Tertullian) nihil habet quod vitra credat:</hi> He that beleeueth this, hath no Obligation to beleeue any thing el≈øe: and this is that which we ought to beleeue without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adding or dimini≈øhing.</p>
            <p>I would now demand of the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Papalins,</hi> in what <hi>Go≈øpell,</hi> in what <hi>Apo≈øtle,</hi> in what <hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Euangeli≈øt,</hi> or Book of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> they find either Pope or his ≈øupremacy? where are his Pardons? where is his Ma≈ø≈øe? where Images? together with many other his Fopperies, which now they hold to be very precious. We reade in the 20. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that almighty God doth expre≈øly forbid the making of any <hi>Image,</hi> to repre≈øent the Per≈øon of Almighty God, or to do any ≈øeruice and obey ≈øance to any <hi>Picture,</hi> or repre≈øentation of the creature: for fir≈øt God is a Spirit invi≈øible, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øible, and Eternall, and therefore hee cannot be ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by any Image or creature, which is both corporall and momentary, and therefore God in his ≈øecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement forbiddeth all ≈øeruice done vnto Images: but contrary vnto this the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth command

            <p>All which can bee no le≈ø≈øe then gro≈ø≈øe Idolatry: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, they do not wor≈øhip their Images, as <hi>≈øtocks</hi> and <hi>≈øtones,</hi> but as they repre≈øent either God or ≈øome Saint: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe did not the <hi>I≈øralits,</hi> wor≈øhip their golden Calfe, as the true God, but they did wor≈øhip the true God in the Calfe, and yet notwith≈øtanding, the Text ≈øaith, that they did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry, and many of them were ≈øeuerely puni≈øhed for the ≈øame, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. ≈øo that the Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is as gro≈ø≈øe as that of the <hi>I≈øralites.</hi> What can bee more iniutious vnto God then to hope for helpe of him, and yet notwith≈øtanding to pray vnto a ≈øencele≈ø≈øe ≈øtock?

            </p>
            <p>And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> per≈øwadeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to turne from Idols and Images, and to ≈øerue the euerliuing God, where hee doth v≈øe the word <hi>Duliea,</hi> for the Seruice of the true God, ≈øhewing heereby the oppo≈øition that is betwixt the one and the other, that he that ≈øerueth Images, cannot in any wi≈øe ≈øerue the Almighty God:yea God him≈øelf ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it plainely, in his fir≈øt Commandement, to wor≈øhip and ≈øerue him, only, neither will he giue his Honour to any other.</p>
            <p>In the fir≈øt precept God condemneth all fal≈øe Gods, in the ≈øecond all fal≈øe wor≈øhiping, of the true God, as making of Images vnto God, or yeelding vnto the Image any part of deuotion which belongeth vnto the Lord.

            <p>The 2. <hi>Motiue</hi> that moued me to leaue the <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they do as it were hood-winke the people in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, giuing a <hi>Seruice</hi> in a language they vnder≈øtand not, amazing them with many outward Ornaments, and huge heapes of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> calling <hi>Ignorance</hi> the the Mother of Deuotion, and <hi>Images</hi> Layemens Books. But we reade in the Councell of <hi>Tolledo</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that <hi>Ignorantia e≈øt mater omnium errorum,</hi> Ignorance is the mother of <hi>Deuotion,</hi> but rather of <hi>Athei≈øme,</hi> and the roote of all errour. What ≈øhould it auaile <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to ≈øpeake in Hehrew to a man of <hi>Africa,</hi> who vnder≈øtands no Hebrew, and what may it auaile the people of other countries to heare their common Seruice in a tongue they vnder≈øtand not: for albeit they heare with their eares, they vnder≈øtand not with their hearts, they are not much better then Birds and Parrats which babble much, and vnder≈øtand nothing: Therefore in the primatiue Church; when Faith was then in learning, the prayers &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seruice was ≈øet fourth in a common tongue, knowne vnto the people that they might vnder≈øtand what they did profe≈ø≈øe, and to be able to giue a rea≈øon of their faith.</p>
            <p>When Almighty God appointed <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to open the Law for the direction of his Church, he decreed it as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerla≈øting duty to all his people, that the booke of the <hi>Law</hi> ≈øhold not depart out of their mouthes, but that they ≈øhould meditate therein day and night, to ob≈øerue and doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all that is written: But how ≈øhould they meditate in them if they be vnknown to them? and how ≈øhould they

            <p>And when ≈øhee hath enriched the Clo≈ø≈øet of her heart with ≈øuch riches, then let her learne the doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the bookes of <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> This was the practice and v≈øe of the Church in Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> time, and long after him, as may appeare by Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> in his Pa≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis.</p>
            <p>If the reading of the Scriptures may bee forbidden becau≈øe ≈øome abu≈øe them; in the v≈øing: then al≈øo may the Sacraments be forbidden, becau≈øe they are ≈øometimes abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed in the receiuing, which to doe were a thing much di≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Gods will &amp; pernicious vnto his Church: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the propo≈øing their ≈øeruice in a ≈øtrange language, and forbidding the people the reading of the Scriptures, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together again≈øt Gods word &amp; the ancient cu≈øtome of the Primatiue Church, and ≈øo by con≈øequence is not to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by any of the children of the Church of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>A third rea≈øon that moued me to follow this pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution was, that they hold again≈øt all Scripture, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall rea≈øon Purgatory, that is, a purging fire after this life to clen≈øe our ≈øins. Again≈øt this opinion of the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> our Sauiour him≈øelfe in the 16. of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> doth much
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15581:8"/>confute, where he maketh mention only of 2. places; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Heauen and Hell: ≈øaying, that the rich mans ≈øoule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently after death went to Hell and there was tormented; and <hi>Lazarus</hi> ≈øoule, at his death, was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo≈øome, a place of ioy and comfort. For as Saint <hi>Ciprian</hi> ≈øaith again≈øt <hi>Demetrian,</hi> that after this life there is no place of Repentance, there is no ≈øatisfaction more to be made, life is heere either lo≈øt or won by the due wor≈øhipping of God, and the fruits of faith; So the ≈øame Author ≈øaith in the ≈øame Treati≈øe, that if a man in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting hence doth ≈øincerely acknowledge his ≈øinnes, and truly imbrace Gods Word, thus confe≈ø≈øing, and thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, he hath free pardon and forgiuene≈ø≈øe granted him of all his ≈øinnes, by Gods goodne≈ø≈øe and free mercy, and at that very in≈øtant pa≈ø≈øeth to immortality: Euen in the la≈øt moment of his life God refu≈øeth not <hi>Repentance,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer is truely done, is not to late done.</p>
            <p>And Saint <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> in his Booke <hi>Debono Mortis</hi> ≈øaith, that he that in this life receiueth not remi≈ø≈øion of his ≈øinnes, ≈øhall not haue remi≈ø≈øion in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Now if their ≈øinnes be forgiuen in this world, likewi≈øe the puni≈øhment due to the ≈øame is al≈øo forgiuen in this world, and ≈øo there can remaine no Purgatorie to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them in the next life. But certaine it is, that the bloud of Chri≈øt doth clen≈øe vs from all our ≈øinnes, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øaith, and is the onely Purgatory, that a Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man ≈øhould hold, which doth deliuer his people as well from the puni≈øhment due to ≈øins, as from the ≈øinne it ≈øelfe: for as the Prophes <hi>E≈øay</hi> ≈øaith, our puni≈øhment was laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and with his ≈øtripes wee are healed. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øt.</hi> in his Sermon <hi>De tempore</hi> 232. ≈øaith, there are but 2. places, hee that reigneth not with Chri≈øt at his departure

            <p>Now if this be true, as mo≈øt true it is, then the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Ma≈ø≈øe ≈øo much e≈øteemed in the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> ≈øeruice, is but a forgery: For fir≈øt it cannot be propitiatory for the dead: <hi>for as the Tree falleth ≈øo it lyeth,</hi> and as man is found in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, ≈øo goeth he to Hell or to Heauen. A third place is not mentioned, now if any be in Heauen, <hi>Ma≈ø≈øes</hi> cannot auaile them, for they enjoy all bli≈ø≈øe po≈ø≈øibly already, if they be in Hell, we read, <hi>ab inferno non e≈øt redemptio,</hi> out of Hell there is no redemption, for as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>a man can by no means redeeme his brother, he cannot pay his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome to God, ≈øo precious is the redemption of ≈øoules, and the continuance for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ≈øo it is cleare, that for the dead it cannot be propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory, and as for the liuing it cannot benefite them, for then were it derogatory to the Pa≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øt once offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for all vpon the Cro≈ø≈øe: who≈øe Oblation was ab≈øolute and perfect as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 5. to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 6.7. ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and therefore needeth not <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe,</hi> or any thing el≈øe to helpe it, yea it were gro≈ø≈øe and damnable to ≈øuppo≈øe any imperfection in that Sacrifice and Oblation of our Sauiour once offred on the Cro≈ø≈øe, ≈øeeing that God the Father twi≈øe ≈øpake from Heauen with a loud voyce, ≈øaying <hi>this is my beloved Sonne in whom I am well plea≈øed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Rea≈øon, that moued mee to renounce my former profe≈ø≈øion with the <hi>Romani≈øts</hi> is that, they quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the words of our <hi>Sauiour</hi> and the whole v≈øe of the ancient Chri≈øtians abu≈øe the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, partly by adding, and partly by dimini≈øhing, from the ≈øame, when our Sauiour ≈øpake the≈øe words, <hi>hoc e≈øt corpus
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15581:9"/>meum:</hi> This is my Body, hee expounded him≈øelfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently ≈øaying, it is the <hi>Spirit</hi> that giueth life, the <hi>Fle≈øh</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing. The≈øe words are ≈øpoken ≈øpiritually, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you mu≈øt vnder≈øtand them ≈øpiritually. Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtine</hi> in his Commentaries vpon the 98. <hi>P≈øalme</hi> ≈øaith, you ≈øhall not eate this Body that you ≈øee, neither ≈øhall you drinke that Bloud which vpon the Cro≈ø≈øe was once ≈øhed: for our Sauior recommended vnto vs a Sacrament (to wit) that which you ≈øee on the Table is Bread, and that which you ≈øee in the Cup is wine, but touching that wherein your faith is to be in≈øtructed, is the Body and Bloud of Chri≈øt For as Bapti≈øme doth change a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to grace, yet notwith≈øtanding he remaines the ≈øelfe≈øame man according to vi≈øible mea≈øure as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but inui≈øibly by grace is made another man; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly nothing is added, but inwardly all is changed: So in the ble≈ø≈øed Sacrament, outwardly nothing is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but there remaineth true Bread and true Wine, but inwardly by faith, we apprehend the Body and Bloud of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>But the≈øe words which our Sauiour ≈øpake figuratiuely, the Papi≈øts expounds them literally, and thereby they cau≈øe the people to commit Idolatry, by adoring Bread as God: for they hold that after the words of Con≈øecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there remaineth no longer Bread nor Wine, but there is really and Tran≈øub≈øtantially the Body and Bloud of Chri≈øt. But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øaith, that the Heauens mu≈øt containe the Body of Chri≈øt vntill the end of the World.</p>
            <p>Now if Chri≈øts Body bee in Heauen; then it cannot bee in the Earth at once, and the ≈øame time: for as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15581:10"/>Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine, Tractatu 3. in Iohannem. Corpus Domini in quo re≈øurrexit, vno tantum in loco e≈ø≈øe pote≈øt.</hi> If they ≈øay that it is done by miracle in the Sacrament, then it ≈øhould be vi≈øible, to the outward eye and ≈øences. When Chri≈øt turned water into Wine, it was vi≈øible Wine. When <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> Rod was turned into a Serpent, it was a vi≈øible Serpent, and ≈øo if the Bread be turned into the Body, and the Wine into the Bloud of Chri≈øt, it mu≈øt al≈øo be a vi≈øible body.</p>
            <p>But if they expound the≈øe words of our Sauiour, <hi>hoc e≈øt corpus meum</hi> literally, to belong vnto all, why ≈øhould they not al≈øo expound the words following literally, that when he tooke the Cup, he ≈øaid, <hi>This is my bloud,</hi> ≈øhould be appertayning to all a≈øwel as the Bread. In the old Law Circumci≈øion was called the Lords Couenant, when it was not the Couenant but a Signe thereof: For the Couenant was this to <hi>Abraham: Ego ero Deus tuus &amp; Deus ≈øeminis tui.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewi≈øe the Pa≈øcall <hi>Lambe</hi> was called the <hi>Pa≈ø≈øeouer</hi> of the Lord, when it was but the ≈øigne of the Pa≈ø≈øeouer, as pa≈ø≈øing ouer the red Sea, ≈øo that it may ≈øtand with good Rea≈øon, that Chri≈øt called the Bread his Body, as hee called the Pa≈øcall Lambe his Pa≈ø≈øeouer, and yet was but a ≈øigne thereof, ≈øo the Bread is called his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and is but a ≈øigne or remembrance of the ≈øame: and therefore it is called a Sacrament becau≈øe that in it one thing is ≈øeene, and another thing vnder≈øtood that which is ≈øeene is Bread, and Wine, and hath a vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apparance or forme, but that which is vnder≈øtood hath a ≈øpirituall v≈øe and profit.</p>
            <p>So that the thing which ≈øignifieth, is oft-times called
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:15581:10"/>by the name of the thing which it ≈øignifieth, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Rocke Chri≈øt, yet it was not Chri≈øt by ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, but by ≈øignification; euen ≈øo our Sauiour ≈øaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> when he gaue Bread the ≈øigue of his Body, and the Apo≈øtle ≈øaid, the Rock was Chri≈øt, for that the Rocke which they ≈øpake of ≈øignified Chri≈øt. The Go≈øpell ≈øtandeth not in the words of the Scripture but in the meaning.</p>
            <p>Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, that the Communicant doth eate Bread after Con≈øecration; for if the Bread were who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly Tran≈øub≈øtantiated into the Body of Chri≈øt, hence it followeth that euery one that doth receiue the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth al≈øo eate the Body of Chri≈øt, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot be damned. For our Sauiour ≈øaith, <hi>He that eateth my Fle≈øh, and drinketh my Bloud hath eternall life:</hi> &amp; ≈øo by this rule the wicked ≈øhall be ≈øaued as well as the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Moreouer if Chri≈øt be pre≈øent according to his humane Nature, then is it no Sacrament: for euery Sacrament is a ≈øigne, &amp; <hi>inanis e≈øt ≈øigni vi≈øus vbi resip≈øa pre≈øens e≈øt</hi> the ≈øigne is to no effect, where the thing it ≈øelfe is pre≈øent. And it is to be noted likewi≈øe, that the ≈øigne mu≈øt haue ≈øome Analogie with the thing that it ≈øignifieth: Now the thing ≈øignified is the Body and Bloud of Chri≈øt, which is true meate &amp; true drinke, as our Sauiour him≈øelfe witne≈ø≈øeth, in St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but the <hi>≈øpecies</hi> or accidents of Bread and Wine are not true meate, nor true drinke, &amp; by that meanes cannot giue any fit proportion with the thing ≈øignified by them. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is an Axiome in Phylo≈øophy, that <hi>accidentis e≈ø≈øe e≈øt in e≈ø≈øe,</hi> that the being of an accident is to be in ≈øome ≈øubiect. But the≈øe accidents as colour, ≈øauour and roundne≈ø≈øe, they cannot bee in any ≈øubiect and ≈øo by con≈øequence they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exi≈øt in the Sacrament.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:15581:11"/>
            <p> For they cannot be in the body of Chri≈øt becau≈øe it is glorified: but the accidents are ≈øubiect to corruption; and therfore they mu≈øt either exi≈øt without a ≈øubiect, which is contrary to <hi>Phylo≈øophy,</hi> or el≈øe to bee ≈øeated in the Body of Chri≈øt which is now glorified, and this is impo≈ø≈øible. It is further to be noted that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and curtall this Sacrament, for they take the bloud of our Sauiour (which is our redemption) from the lay-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: yet certaine it is that our Sauiour did in≈øtitute this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vnder both kinds, and as he ≈øaid to all, take &amp; eate, this is my Body: So did he likewi≈øe ≈øpeake vnto all, when he deliuered the <hi>Cup;</hi> ≈øaying, <hi>drinke ye all of this?</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ≈øayth, <hi>As often as ye eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup, ye ≈øhew forth the Lords death vntill he come</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hailes</hi> ≈øaith, whole Chri≈øt is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned vnder each kind, but the Fle≈øh only vnder the forme of Bread, and the Bloud vnder the forme of Wine. And heere vpon <hi>Gela≈øius,</hi> Pope, made a Decree that they ≈øhould either receiue the whole vnder both kinds, or receiue none at all vnder any kinde: For there can bee no deui≈øion of this one Sacrament and high mi≈øtery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Sacriledge; ≈øo that by their owne Doctors it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident that they commit great Sacriledge in deuiding this Sacrament, and do much abu≈øe the people of God in deceiuing them of the precious Bloud of our Sauiour.</p>
            <p>The 5. <hi>Motiue</hi> which mooued mee to per≈øi≈øt in this my enterpri≈øe, is, that the <hi>Pope</hi> challengeth authority vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe to forgiue ≈øinnes, and thereupon ≈øendeth forth his Bulls, Pardons, and Indulgences, pardoning whom he li≈øt, and as he li≈øt, as if he were God him≈øelfe, hauing ab≈øolute
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15581:11"/>power to do what he li≈øt, in≈øomuch as Traytors and Rebels again≈øt God and their lawfull Prince, hee will not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don without exception, but he will enable them in their damnable cour≈øes, to the ouerthrowing of them≈øelues and their Princes. What the Religion of <hi>Rome</hi> is, it may ea≈øily appeare by this, that a man may haue for money a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> or di≈øpen≈øation for any ≈øinne, a <hi>Popes</hi> pardon is ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all: but to what end ≈øerueth pardons, when as there is no Purgatorie? for neither the ancient Fathers make mention of it, and the <hi>Grecians</hi> vntill this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it not. <hi>Silue≈øter Prierias</hi> in his Booke again≈øt <hi>Luther,</hi> ≈øaith, that Pardons are not knowne vnto vs by any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scriptures, but by authorie of the Pope, which is greater then the authority of the Scriptures: <hi>Vox bouis non hominis.</hi> It is the voice or ≈øaying of ≈øome Bea≈øt, and not of any Chri≈øtian man.</p>
            <p>Certaine I am that the Pope cannot ju≈øtifie an vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man whom God abhorreth, neither can he condemn the faithfull who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> God doth much tender and fauour: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Pardons are rather pernitious then any whit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to the per≈øons that buy them, bearing them in peace and ≈øecurity, when indeede they are in much perill and mi≈øery.</p>
            <p>VVhere doe they find that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath any ≈øuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ouer Kings, Princes, or Emperours; that hee hath any authority to depo≈øe them from their Crownes, and dignities, and to ab≈øolue their ≈øubiects from their Oath and Allegeance which they haue ≈øworne vnto their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: That vpon his Excommunication it is lawfull for them to rebell again≈øt them, and ≈øo practi≈øe all Ho≈øtility to depo≈øe them?</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:15581:12"/>
            <p> There is not one word ≈øentence or place out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to proue it; no precept or example of antiquity to warrant it, and yet they commend it for a chiefe point and ground of Catholike and Chri≈øtian faith.</p>
            <p>By what right doth he claime this ≈øupreme authority: if he clayme it as a ≈øucce≈ø≈øor of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Peter,</hi> it is impo≈ø≈øible, for that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> neuer had any ≈øuch Title or preeminence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the re≈øt of the Apo≈øtles.</p>
            <p>It is true that Chri≈øt ≈øaid to <hi>Peter, Thou art Peter, and vpon this Rock I wil build my Church.</hi> The≈øe words hitherto giue no ≈øuperiority to <hi>Peter</hi> aboue the re≈øt. Only they ≈øhew that the Church is built <hi>non ≈øuper petrum ≈øed ≈øuper Petram,</hi> not vpon the per≈øon of <hi>Peter</hi> but vpon the Rocke: Of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Petra autem erat Chri≈øtus,</hi> the Rock was Chri≈øt, whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> confe≈ø≈øed to be the Sonne of the euerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God.</p>
            <p>This confe≈ø≈øion of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is, that Chri≈øt is the Rock wherevpon the Church is builded, <hi>aliud fundamentum nemo, pote≈øt ponere ni≈øi id quod po≈øitum e≈øt Chri≈øtus Ie≈øus.</hi> Other Foundation can no man lay, but that which is laid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: namely, Chri≈øt Ie≈øus.</p>
            <p>Where then ≈øhall wee find that <hi>Peter</hi> was made Prince of the Apo≈øtles, to rule ouer all the re≈øt, as our Popes doe now?</p>
            <p>But what hath the Pope to doe with <hi>Peter?</hi> or what doth the Pope doe as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did? Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did conuert ≈øoules, plant Churches, and preach the Word of God vnto all Nations, but in what Pulpit hath our Popes euer ≈øet foote? where haue they preached the Go≈øpell or expounded the Word.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt Le≈ø≈øon that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth vs, is to feare
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:15581:12"/>God, the next is, to Honour the King. <hi>Quis haec e≈øt voluntas Dei,</hi> for this is the will of God. But the Popes ≈øay, that they are Princes aboue Nations and Kingdomes: they can depo≈øe Kings, and pull downe Emperours, they haue authority ouer their ≈øubiects, to di≈øcharge them from their Oathes, they haue the right and clayme vnto both ≈øwords, as well temporall as ≈øpirituall: And that all Kings and Princes ought to depend at their beck, and to ≈øweare obedience, vnto their holine≈ø≈øe, as to their ≈øupreame heads and Soueraignes, vnder the paine and lo≈ø≈øe of all their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>We reade that <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight becau≈øe he could not haue the trea≈øury of <hi>France,</hi> at his command, endeauoured by all meanes po≈ø≈øible to remoue <hi>Phillip</hi> the French King from his e≈øtate, and vnder his Bulls and Letters Pattents, made a deede of gift of all the ≈øtate of <hi>France</hi> vnto <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> then King of the Romans.</p>
            <p>As touching the Kings of this our Realme of England: as our duty and alleageance bindeth vs, we may iu≈øtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. by violence and tyrran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forced King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øecond to ≈øurrender vp his Crowne Imperiall into his Legats hands, and afterward for a certaine ≈øpace to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tent him in priuate e≈øtate, to the great indignation and griefe of his louing ≈øubiects.

            <p> Surely no, it is meere ≈øacriledge again≈øt God, and tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny ouer his Princes and Vice-gerents, and not the part of any Mini≈øter of Chri≈øt or ≈øucce≈ø≈øor of the Apo≈øtles.</p>
            <p>For fir≈øt Chri≈øt him≈øelfe ≈øaith, <hi>that his Kingdome is not of this world.</hi> He him≈øelfe likewi≈øe refu≈øed to be made a King.

            </p>
            <p>Now if Chri≈øt him≈øelfe was ≈øubiect vnto <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all others to be ≈øubiect and obedient vnto him, it is a ≈øhame for the By≈øhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to exalt him≈øelfe aboue <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> and to animate others again≈øt him. <hi>Imperium in Principe &amp; obedientia in ≈øubdito, e≈øt de inre diuino,</hi> Rule in the Prince, and obedience in the Subiect, are both immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly from God; and as euery member of the body naturall mu≈øt ≈øubiect it ≈øelfe vnto the rule and regiment of the head if it meane to liue and thriue: So mu≈øt euery ≈øubiect in the body politicke, be ≈øubiect and gouerned by the Prince which is the head of all, and aboue all. And therefore they are called in the <hi>P≈øalmes Vose≈øtis Dij,</hi> yee are as Gods, ≈øo that he which contemneth them, contemneth God; they are called nour≈øing Fathers, that we ≈øhould alwayes loue and reuerence them like vnto our Fathers; they are al≈øo called Kings Princes and Rulers of the Earth, which are Names and Titles of honour, ≈øo that tho≈øe whom God vouch≈øafeth thus to Honour, we ought without all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to loue, honour, and obey. Therefore euery ≈øoule that is ≈øubiect to God mu≈øt bee ≈øubiect to them, becau≈øe he that calleth them Kings calleth vs ≈øubiects: this is their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that God hath cho≈øen them Kings, and ≈øet them vpon the Throne to rule his people, and hath commanded euery

            <p>So that it is a thing mo≈øt certaine that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no authority ouer Kings either in Eccle≈øia≈øticall or Temporall matters, but is therein an V≈øurper, Intruder, and a mo≈øt odious Traytor, both to God and Prince: for all the ancient Churches haue affirmed, and euer acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the ≈øupreame auhority of Princes, aboue all Prie≈øts and people what≈øoeuer.</p>

            <p>It is a difficult thing to re≈øi≈øt Gods voice, to fight again≈øt the truth; which di≈øcouereth her ≈øelfe ≈øo apparantly; my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience ≈øtill vrging me, I could doe no le≈ø≈øe then retire my ≈øelfe back vnto the Lord, from whom I haue long erred &amp; gone a≈øtray, ≈øaying as <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> was wont to ≈øay, <hi>Socrates</hi> is my friend, &amp; ≈øo is <hi>Plato</hi> my friend, but the friend≈øhip of the truth is far aboue all. I can no longer beare witne≈ø≈øe again≈øt God, it is no longer ≈øecure, to call good euill, or euill good, light darkene≈ø≈øe, or darkene≈ø≈øe light. I mu≈øt not be a≈øhamed of the Go≈øpell of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, for it is the mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God vnto ≈øaluation: It is now high time to ≈øet a≈øide all blinde affection, and to iudge vprightly. It is dangerous to ioyne with them that haue burnt Gods Word; and ≈øcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called it a leaden rule, &amp; a No≈øe made of waxe, that call ignorance the mother of Deuotion, &amp; dumb Images Lay mens Bookes, who forbid marriage, and lycence Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, who haue deui≈øed vnto them≈øelues a ≈øtrange Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contrary to the Scriptures, ancient Coun≈øels, old doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and example of the Primatiue Church: whom ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kingdomes, countries and infinite thou≈øands of godly people haue for≈øaken: From whom the holy Gho≈øt by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe words hath commanded vs to depart: as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> Come away from her O my people that ye be not partakers of her ≈øinnes, le≈øt ye be al≈øo parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of her plagues: for ≈øhe hath fal≈øified the holy farthers with ≈øuch tran≈ølations and expo≈øitions, not as may be≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe their meanings, but as may be≈øt further their owne preten≈øes, and purpo≈øes, they wre≈øt them, they alter them,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15581:15"/>they put to them, and take from them: ≈øometimes they take the bare words again≈øt the meaning, and ≈øometimes they frame a meaning again≈øt the words: they imagine coun≈øels that were neuer lied, <hi>Canons</hi> of coun≈øels that were neuer ≈øeene, they bring forged Pamphlets vnder the name of <hi>Athana≈øius. Anacletus,</hi> and other godly Fathers by whom they were neuer made. The≈øe are not errors in manners which may be in any good Church, but they are errors in Faith and Doctrine, which cannot ≈øtand with the true Church. And therefore as Saint <hi>Ciprian</hi> ≈øaith, let not lies deceiue vs any longer, it is night vntill the day ≈øpring, but when the Day appeareth, and the Sunne of truth is vp, both the darkene≈ø≈øe of the night, as al≈øo the thefts commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in darkene≈ø≈øe will appeare and giue place. Now the Sunne of truth is vp, and the Clouds of ignorance are ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, I will ≈øay with Saint <hi>Paul, Let vs ca≈øt away darkene≈ø≈øe, and put on the armour of light:</hi> To maintaine a fault knowne, is a double fault: Errour cannot ≈øtand but by errour, and the mouth that ≈øpeaketh vntruth killeth the ≈øoule. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may ≈øafely and ioyfully ≈øay, <hi>Bonum e≈øt mihi domine, quia humilia≈øti me, vt di≈øcam in≈øti≈øicationes tuas,</hi> It is good for me that I haue beene in trouble, for thereby I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thy truth.</p>
            <p>O my God leade, me in the truth, teach mee to do thy will.
